# Coolio

Coolio is a cool small project with a cool name. It basically searches for keywords and retrives data from mock backend.
Vue.js and it's ecosystem has been adopted on the client side while [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) is exploited as a server. For the whole list of packages used in the project, please checkout [package.json](https://github.com/mehmeteyupoglu/coolio/blob/main/package.json).
